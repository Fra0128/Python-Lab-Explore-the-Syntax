    "Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It is known for its clear and readable syntax, which emphasizes simplicity and reduces code complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Key Terms:\n",
    "- **High-level Language**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python is defined as \"high-level\" because:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It's closer to human language than machine language.\n",
    "    - It abstracts many low-level computer details, such as memory management.\n",
    "    - It allows writing more intuitive and less verbose code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpreted**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python is an interpreted language, which means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The source code is executed directly by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "    - It doesn't require a separate compilation phase before execution.\n",
    "    - It allows for greater flexibility and ease of debugging, but can be less efficient in terms of performance compared to compiled languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **General-purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Being \"general-purpose\" implies that Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Is not specialized for a single problem domain.\n",
    "    - Can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis, from automation to machine learning.\n",
    "    - Offers flexibility in approaching problem-solving in different contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy to Learn**: Intuitive syntax and code readability make Python ideal for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Versatile**: Used in various fields such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extensive Standard Library**: Provides modules and tools for many common tasks, reducing the need for external code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-platform Support**: Works on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Active Community**: A vast community of developers contributing libraries, frameworks, and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpreted**: Doesn't require compilation, allowing for rapid prototyping and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
